## 🚀 Quick Start

### Console Tool

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

# Analyze two ETFs
python etf_overlap.py --isin1 IE00B4L5Y983 --isin2 IE00B3RBWM25

# Analyze multiple ETFs
python etf_overlap.py --multi IE00B4L5Y983,IE00B3RBWM25,IE00BK5BQT80

# Get JSON output for integration
python etf_overlap.py --multi IE00B4L5Y983,IE00B3RBWM25 --json

# Expire cache and fetch fresh data
python etf_overlap.py --multi IE00B4L5Y983,IE00B3RBWM25 --expire-cache
```

### Web Interface

```bash
cd etf_web
pip install flask flask-limiter python-dotenv

# Copy .env.example to .env and set your password
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set AUTH_PASSWORD

python app.py  # Runs on http://localhost:3003
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Diversification Scoring
The tool calculates a diversification score (0-100) based on total overlap percentage:
- **80-100**: Excellent diversification, minimal overlap
- **60-79**: Good diversification with some overlap
- **40-59**: Moderate overlap, consider adjustments
- **0-39**: High overlap, poor diversification

### Caching Mechanism
- Uses SQLite database (`etf_cache.db`)
- Data cached for 24 hours to reduce API calls
- Cache can be expired manually with `--expire-cache` flag

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Strict ISIN format validation (regex: `^[A-Z]{2}[A-Z0-9]{9}[0-9]$`)
- **Web Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth required for web interface
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the web API

**NO FINANCIAL ADVICE**: This tool provides data analysis only. It does not provide financial advice or recommendations. Consult a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.

**SCRAPING RESPONSIBILITY**: This tool scrapes data from justetf.com. Users are solely responsible for complying with justetf.com's terms of service and applicable laws. Use at your own risk.

**DATA ACCURACY**: Results depend on data availability from justetf.com. Some ETFs may not have holdings information available.

## 🔧 Security Notes

- **Web Server**: Flask development server is not production-ready. Use with production WSGI server for deployment.
- **Input Validation**: Basic validation is implemented but additional hardening may be needed for public deployment.
- **Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting is implemented in console tool. Consider adding if exposing to public internet.
- **Authentication**: Web interface requires HTTP Basic Auth. Set `AUTH_PASSWORD` in `.env` file.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:
- **Invalid ISIN format**: Ensure ISINs are exactly 12 characters (2 letters + 9 alphanumeric + 1 digit)
- **No holdings data**: Some ETFs don't provide holdings information on justetf.com
- **Cache issues**: Use `--expire-cache` to force fresh data fetch
- **Web auth errors**: Ensure `.env` file exists with valid `AUTH_PASSWORD`
